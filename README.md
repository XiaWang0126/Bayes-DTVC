# Digital Technologies & Value Creation

In this module, students get hands-on experience using business analytics technologies in Python to generate tangible benefits. We start by building the tools to gather data, focusing on web scraping and social media APIs. Students then familiarize themselves with typical technologies used for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. To this aim, we build on real use cases in People and Marketing Analytics. We also see how Social Media Analytics can enrich decision-making in both fields.

While we introduce and use many core analytics tools, the module is not aimed at developing them in depth. Rather, the main takeaway of this module is to familiarize students with the value-generating application of contemporary business analytics tools in practice.

The topics covered include (but are not limited to):
Gathering and pre-processing data: web scraping, extracting data from (social media) APIs, data cleaning, feature engineering
Descriptive analytics: measuring demand, analyzing the effect of promotions, measuring organizational culture from social media data
Predictive analytics: customer segmentation, target marketing, valuing social media platforms, predicting employee retention
Prescriptive analytics: experiments in organizational design, optimizing restructuring decisions, A/B testing
